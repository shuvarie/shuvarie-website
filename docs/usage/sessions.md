Sessions live in an embedded SQLite database at `<project>/.shuvarie/`
(auto-gitignored; `--dir` relocates it). A session is created by your first
prompt — titled from it — and every message, tool call and scroll position
is persisted immediately, so killing the terminal loses nothing.

- **Resume** with `shuvarie -c`, `shuvarie -s <UUID>`, or `/sessions`
  (<kbd>Enter</kbd> resume, <kbd>N</kbd> new, <kbd>Ctrl+D</kbd> delete with
  confirmation).
- **One knight per horse**: a session locks while it is open elsewhere, and
  the picker marks it *in use*.
- **History is a tree.** `/undo` forks before the last prompt, `/replay`
  forks and re-runs it, and `/tree` walks the whole tree — <kbd>Enter</kbd>
  forks from a node, `s` summarizes the forked-away prefix, `d` deletes a
  branch (confirmed). Files on disk are never reverted.
- **Export / import.** `/export [path]` (or `--export-session [FILE]`)
  writes a self-contained JSON snapshot; `--import-session <FILE>` restores
  one. [Embeddings](/docs/configuration/providers/) are regenerated on
  import.
